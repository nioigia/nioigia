  Heya! I'm **bonn** a senior high school student with the strand **Information and Communication Technology**. I chose that strand to enhance my programming skills—as I got inspired to create something groundbreaking with my set of skills—and let just say that i'm still in the beginner stage unfortunately. However, I will try to learn and experiment more to become a professional programmer!
