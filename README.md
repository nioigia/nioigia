- Heya! I'm Bonn, a senior high school student under the Information and Communication Technology strand. I chose this strand to improve my programming skills—since I was inspired to create something meaningful with them—and let’s just say I’m still at the beginner stage for now. Even so, I’m eager to keep learning and experimenting until I can grow into a professional programmer!

- **Expected projects:**
  - Websites using HTML, CSS, Java. 
  - Input/Output projects using C.
  - Discord bots using Python.
